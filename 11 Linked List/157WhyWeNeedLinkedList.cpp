/*
We are the programmers, but it's up to
the user to decide the number of element 
he/she wants to store in the array.
But as a programmer, we need to declare
the size of an array at compile time.
So in this type of case where size of
array is not known to us. LL comes handy
Array elements are contiguous,but LL not.
Conclusion-:
For variable data structure, which can
grow or reduce we use LL.
