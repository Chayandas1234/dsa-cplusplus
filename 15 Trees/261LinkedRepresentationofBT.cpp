/*
For storing the elements of tree in 
Linked List we need to initialize a class
or structure with these properties:
struct Node {
    struct Node* lchild;
    int data;
    struct Node* rchild;
}
There are total(n+1) NULL pointers if 'n'
elements are present in the tree.
Similar to (e = n+1) formula.
